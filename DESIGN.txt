TROLL - Version ConTROLL Software
by Kevin Wang, Eric Lam

This software is meant to be used as any other version control software, like Git.

Our version control software will use a combination of file storage and hashing to keep track of files. Several "objects" will keep track of the files into different groups, or commits.

Troll is very heavy on file manipulation, including a lot of reading a writing.

No credit for any one piece can be given to any single person. Even the Git history may not be accurate, as the two of us may have worked on a single computer.
